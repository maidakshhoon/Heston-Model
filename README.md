# Heston Model Volatility Arbitrage with Pairs Trading

## Overview
This project implements a pairs trading strategy using the Heston Model, which accounts for stochastic volatility. By forecasting future volatility, we aim to exploit mispricings in European options on correlated stocks SPX and NDX. The objective is to identify discrepancies between forecasted and implied volatility, allowing for the purchase of undervalued options and the sale of overvalued ones.

## Project Steps

### 1. Implement the Heston Model
- Develop and calibrate the Heston Model to predict implied volatility using historical data.

### 2. Select and Analyze Correlated Stock Pairs
- Choose pairs based on historical price correlation and validate stability using statistical methods.

### 3. Pairs Trading Based on Volatility Discrepancies
- Track implied volatility against model predictions to identify trading opportunities.

### 4. Backtest the Pairs Trading Strategy
- Collect historical data and evaluate the strategy's performance through backtesting.

### 5. Develop a GUI for Monitoring and Execution
- Create a user-friendly interface to visualize volatility and execute trades.

### 6. Optimize and Iterate on the Strategy
- Refine the model and strategy based on performance metrics and market conditions.

### 7. Trading Engine Component
- Build a trading engine for execution and data processing.

### 8. Paper Trading Simulation
- Simulate trades in a risk-free environment to validate the strategy.

### 9. Order Execution and Position Management
- Implement order execution and risk management strategies for both paper and live trading.

### Optional Enhancements
- Simulate institutional trading conditions and implement dynamic risk management strategies.
